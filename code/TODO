TODO:
- implement early stopping # done
- visualize the loss curve # done
- maby cross-validation 20% set size # done
    - do metrics also for cv sets # done
- evaluate on per protein basis instead of whole set        !!!!!!! doable
- mcc on whole set
- accuracy average on per protein level
- hyperparameter optimization (optimize by mcc)
    - pooling to decrease feature space
    - batch normalization, dropout
    - layer size, amout of layers, decreasing size layers, stagnating size layers
    - bias and hops: bias=False, k=2
    - also look up in the dgl what else to optimize
- different embeddings
    - write fasta to send to michael # in work
    - parse fasta into dictionary to receive in the embeddings function of HZ_full # in work
- visualization of results
- try out different machine learning models
- write evaluation of a model
